## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a student at **NYU Abu Dhabi**, majoring in **Computer Science**. I have been passionate about coding since I was **12 years old**, gaining hands-on experience in:

- Mobile Development  
- Web Development  
- Full Stack Development  
- Competitive Programming

Currently, I maintain a coding project called **LitCode**, which is soon evolving into **Firmacodes** — a work in progress aimed at showcasing my growth and projects in software engineering.

I’m dedicated to continuous learning and excited to prepare for internships and real-world software challenges!
